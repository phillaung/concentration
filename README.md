## Project Description

Welcome, here lies ***Concentration***, a memory card game. This is a first project of mine toward web development during my time of study at the General Assembly software engineering bootcamp. Since this is a first, I've decided to make it manageable by making it 16 cards, and not having the user lose. Bigger, better, and more complicated the projects will be on the way in the foreseeable future.

## How to Play

The cards are shuffled and layed face down. User can turn two cards back to back. If the cards match, the cards stayed shown while the cards turned over if they do not match. Player keep turning the cards till all the cards are faced up where the player wins.
